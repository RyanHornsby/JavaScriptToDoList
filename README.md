# JavaScriptToDoList
A to-do list made with JavaScript.

Features include:
-Adding new tasks
-Editing existing tasks
-Completing tasks
-Removing tasks
-Reordering tasks
-Dark mode toggle

You can press enter on any of the text inputs or click the relevant button. You can also press escape to back out of making changes whilst editing.
Movement arrows smart update to reflect the top and bottom entries of the list. Dark mode handles elements being added after it's already enabled.
You can both complete and uncomplete tasks. Longer tasks wrap around.

The focus was on JavaScript, so it's not designed to be responsive to different size webapges.
